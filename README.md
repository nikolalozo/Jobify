# Jobify - Job search app
This Android application is aimed at simplifying the process of searching for part-time jobs in your surrounding area. Easily locate job offers close to you, apply and earn a pay. 
You can also publish jobs, for which other users can apply and work for you. 

# Instructions 
1. Download and unzip the source repository.
2. Open the app in Android Studio.
3. Run the app. 

# Use
- In order to use the app, you need to create an account. To create an account, click _Register_ and fill in the required data. 
- Upon creating an account, you will be presented with a map of your local area. This is the _Map_ section. There you can find jobs and connections in close proximity to you. Connections are users you have worked for or who have worked for you at some point. By clicking on the _Filter_ icon, you can filter out specific jobs and connections, or you can search for specific jobs and connections by clicking on the _Search_ button.
- By going to the _Profile_ section, you can see your profile, with all of your personal data. There, you can also edit your data, view your connections and job history.
- The _Jobs_ section shows all your pending job requests and offers, as well as jobs you're doing right now. 
- In the _Ranking_ section, you can see which users have done and posted the most jobs.
- Creating a new job offer is as simple as going to the _New Job_ section and filling in the required data. The job will be marked on the map on your current location.
- When a user applies for a job offer you have posted, you have to confirm their request. After that, in order for the job to be marked as done, you and the worker have to be less than 100 meters away from each other. If that condition is fulfilled, both of you have to confirm in the _Jobs_ section that the job has been done. If this was the first time for you two to do business, you will become each other's connection.
